# ZX-POS
This Point of Sale (POS) module for Zen Cart was built to help you overcome the gap between online sales and sales made through other channels. If you have a physical store with customers walking in to make a purchase, you can use this plugin as a cash register (please check your law requirements first). It can also be used to take orders by your staff over the phone.

The Point of Sale module allows you to add products to cart using a barcode scanner, by manually typing in the barcode or by typing in product's model number (or shortcode).

Your customers can use the same account for both online purchases AND in-store purchases. This allows them to keep track of their entire order history in your shop, or earn Loyalty Rewards if you have any.
